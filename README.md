# Open-Data-Task
Open data task summer 2019

The application shows the current data fetched from the given API, and some statistics of all the data gathered.
The adding of new sensor data (to the database) works manually by pressing a button. This could be done automatically by using for example graphQL subscriptions, which I will be learning next month. For now I wasn't able to set up automatic data saving. The history tab lists every saved data.
